# The-Game-of-Craps
This program plays the game of craps by first prompting the user for their bank balance and then asking for their wager.  It rolls the dice and check to see if the player has either won, lost, made their point. The player re-rolls until he has matched the point. If he loses or wins the bank balance is adjusted accordingly.
